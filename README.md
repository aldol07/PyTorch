# PyTorch Notes

This repository contains concise Jupyter notebooks documenting what I've learned while exploring PyTorch.

## Covered Topics

- **Tensors** (`tensors_in_ptorch.ipynb`)  
  Introduction to PyTorch tensors â€” creation, operations, and basic manipulation.

- **Autograd** (`pytorch_autograd.ipynb`)  
  Overview of PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine for gradient computation.

More topics will be added as I progress.
